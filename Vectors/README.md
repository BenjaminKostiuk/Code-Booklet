# Vectors

## Problem Statement
Write a program that implements a 3-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.

### Background
A _vector_ is a mathematical entity that has a direction and magnitude. A three dimensional vector can be represented as a tripe (3-tuple)__V__ = _(x,y,z)_

### Modules
Included are two modules:
* Assign_2 deals with 3rd dimensional vectors.
* Assign_2_ExtraCredit deals with vectors of dimension _n_ using a _Type Class_.

Included functions over vectors include:
* Scalar Product
* Vector Product
* Inner Product
* Magnitude of a vector

### Testing
Included at the end of the file are test cases on various input and output of the program.
