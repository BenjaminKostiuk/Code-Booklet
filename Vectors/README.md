# Project2 : Vectors

### Vectors

The objective of this project was to write a program to deal with vectors of varing dimensions.
Included are two modules:
* Assign_1 deals with 3rd dimensional vectors.
* Assign_1_ExtraCredit deals with vectors of dimensions 2, 3 and 4.

Incluced functions over vectors include:
* Scalar Product
* Vector Product
* Inner Product
* Magnitude of a vector
