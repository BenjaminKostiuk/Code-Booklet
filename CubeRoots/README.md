# Cube Roots

## Problem Statement
Write a program that computes the solutions of a cubic equation. 

### Background
_Remember in Middle School when your teacher showed you something like this and you had no clue how to solve for its roots_: **y = x^3 - 7x^2 + 13x - 2**

Well, now you have a program that can do it for you!
This program uses [Cardano's Formula](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Cardano%27s_Formula) to solve for roots of a cubic.

### Modules
Included are two modules:
* Assign_1 deals with the __real roots__ of cubics.
* Assign_1_ExtraCredit deals with __all roots__ both real and complex of a cubic.

### Testing
Included at the end of the file are test cases on various input and output of the program.
