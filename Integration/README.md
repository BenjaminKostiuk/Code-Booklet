# Integration

## Problem Statement
Write a module for approximating the definite integral of a function f: R -> R using higher-order functions.

### Background
_Ever wonder what that funny skinny "S" stood for in mathematics? Well it's an integral! Based on the __summa__ (latin for sum), meaning the summation of the area covered by an equation f(x)._

A __definite integral__ is the area under a curve from point a to b. It can be approximated using the [Trapezoidal rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule).

### Modules
Assign_5 deals with the definite integral of functions using the _trapezoidal rule_ to approximate. Included are also some simple applications of the definite integral.

### Testing
Included in the /test folder are tests on various input and output.
Also included is are quickCheck properties for Assign_5.
