# Binary

## Problem Statement
Implement both unary and binary addition and multiplication using algebraic data types and compare execution times.

### Background
_They say there are only 10 types of people in this world, those who understand binary and those who don't._

__Natural numbers__ can be represented in a _unary_ format in which _S(S(S(S(S(0)))))_ represents 5.
__Binary numbers__ however can be represented as _1s and 0s_ in which _1001_ represents 9.

Addition and multiplication are easily defined over unary representation however they are very ineffient. Using a _binary_ format however offers much more flexibility and speed.

### Modules
Included is the Assign_4_ExtraCredit that deals with unary and binary representations as well as addition and multiplication over them. 

### Testing
Included in the /test folder are tests on various input and output.
Also included is are quickCheck properties for Assign_4_ExtraCredit.
